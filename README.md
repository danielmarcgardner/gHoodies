# gHoodies
gHoodies was born from a challenge from an instructor to students who wanted their galvanize hoodies before graduation. The instructor challenged those who were interested to build a basic fullstack app he could show school administrators and if it worked the cohort would get their hoodies earlier.

gHoodies allows current Galvanize Students to search and see if they are in the database. If the student is not they can fill out their information to be added along with sizing specifications.
If a student is already in the database they can make changes if needed. To view all records
by cohort there is a 'View Reports' button that generates the information.

Galvanize loved the app and gave all students in the cohort their sweatshirts early.

gHoodies is built with HTML, CSS, Materialize, Javascript, jQuery, Node.js, Express,
Postgesql, and knex. gSwag lead on the Front-End by Thomas Stang (@tkstang) and on the
Back-End by Daniel Gardner (@danielmarcgardner) with contributions by
Randall Spencer (@holdonowgo), Matt Muir (@Mattimus333), and Ryan Thissen (@ryanthissen).
